- Stuff ------------------------------------------------------------------------

[/] File IO
  [x] Open
  [x] Save As
  [ ] Issue saving RGB(0,0,0) as transparent
  [ ] Save
    - Need to store active file handle
  [ ] Error handling or whatever
  [ ] Save progress bar (or indicator at least)
    - "Background file input/output" needs to be enabled, otherwise the program
      will freeze; which is more desirable?
    - "File IO in Progress?" should be the correct conditional
  [ ] Save/load fail notifications
  [ ] Pop-up confirmation when trying to save as JPEG (Warning: This format will
      reduce quality, etc.)
  [ ] General clean-up and considerations
[ ] Resizing canvas
[ ] Scrollbars
[ ] Replace active system buttons with active objects (widget behaviors?)
[ ] Tools system
[ ] UI Resizing
[ ] Pop-up windows
[ ] Bitmap fonts
  - Look at BMP Font Writer for inspiration, especially the File > Font Info.
[ ] Undo/redo
  - Check out quick store, although it looks like it's only for a one-time undo

- Tools ------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Camera tool/system
    - Right-side bar, under the color stuff, has 2 camera views
    - These cameras can be set with the Camera tool (left-click for cam1, right
      click for cam2)
    - Camera views have an 'x' to remove the active camera (and return to "no
      signal")
    - Zooming, panning, etc. don't affect cameras after they've been placed
    - Sidebar is resizable, cameras resize with it (no zoom, just display more
      or less of the active cam area)
- Lasso/polygonal select
    - Lasso by default, hold shift for straights, how else it works i dunno
- Pencil/brush tool
    - 3 parameters
        - Brush shape
            - Bitmap file patterns stored in patterns folder
                - Variable-color brushes: bitmap must contain only black & white
                  pixels, can change the color of these brushes from within the
                  program
                - Static-color brushes: bitmap contains any color(s) other than
                  black & white, cannot change the color of these brushes from
                  within the program
            - Temporary "stamper" brush that can be created from a selection
                - Right click on selection > set as temp brush
        - Brush size
            - Even scales complex patterns
        - Checkbox: Is pattern brush
            - Determines whether the brush should smear or draw a clean pattern

- Stardust Paint is freeware. If you've paid money for Stardust Paint, you
  should absolutely demand a refund. If you like Stardust Paint, tell your
  friends about it! Maybe give it to them as a Christmas present (but in that
  case don't tell them it's free)!

- "I will conquer the world with my tools" - Dr. Eggman
  
  Tools are an integral part of any painting experience. After all, you can't
  paint without tools! Well, you can, but it's probably not as fulfilling. I've
  tried to keep the toolset as straight-forward as possible, yet feature-filled
  enough to be useful and get some real work done with.
  Simple, yet powerful: that's the goal for Stardust Paint.
